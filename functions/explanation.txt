Basic functions
- We have built in functions that we have explored example: 
    prompt(), log(), push(), shift(), sort()
- These function are predefined in the javascript compiler
- The function definition part is hidden from us we are only interacting with the function 
calling only.

User Defined functions
- These are functions that we take part in creating both the function definition and the function calling.

function definition

function definiton syntax:

    function nameOfTheFunction(){
        // content of the function or body of the function
    }

    - function definition starts with the keyword "function" followed by the function name, which must be
    a valid identifier.
    - after the function name we have a bracket ( ) inside the bracket we can have parameter or not.
    - after bracket we have the opening culry bracket "{" and closing curly bracket "}" inside them we have the
    function block of code that is executed when the function is called.
    - a function definition cannot be executed before until you perfrom a function call.

    example of a function without parameter in side the bracket
    function sayHello(){
        //block of code goes here...
    }

    example of a function with paremeters
    function hello(parameter1, parameter2){
        //block of code goes here...
    }

    what is a paremeter 
        paremeter - is a variable that gets initialized with the value supplied as argument
        during function calling.
        argument - is a value supplied during function calling to initialize the parameter

function calling
 - this is calling the function that you have Defined. There are severa ways a function call is performed
 - the function name used in the definition must be the same as the name used in calling inconsisitency will result 
 in syntax error.
    a) Simple call
        this is the situation where there is no parameter in the function call in other words those function without
        parameters are termed as void, is called. here the the function name is supplied with empty brackets.
        
        // function definition
        function sayHello(){
        console.log("Hello);
        }

        // function calling
        sayHello(); // just called the function directly.


    a) call by value
    this is where you supply the values directly inside the brackets of a function call.

        // parameter function
        function rectangle(length, width){
        let area = length * width;
        console.log(area);
        }

        // function calling
        rectangle(67, 40);


    b) call by reference
        // function definition
        function rectangle(length, width){
            let area = length * width;
            console.log(area);
        }

        // function calling
        let l = 80;
        let w = 45;
        rectangle(l , w);
