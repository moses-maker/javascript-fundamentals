Operators
- They are used when you want to work with numbers, in doing
calculations.
- Operators are used to operate on values.

Examples
a) Arithmetic Operators
-  Arithmetic operators can be used to perform operations with
 numbers.
- They include:
    addition +
    subtraction - 
    Multiplication *
    Division /
    Exponent **
    Modulus %
    Unary operators (increment ++ , decerement --)
    Prefix and Postfix operators. 

b) Assignment operators
- Assugnment operator is used to assign values to a variable. 
- The character for this basic assignment operation is "=".
- Example
    let t = 7;
    - here assignment operator "=" assigns the value "7" to
    the variable "t".

- We have compound assignment operators that combine the 
assignment operator with the arithmetic operator example:
    addition assignment +=
    subtraction assignment -=
    multiplication assignment *=
    division assignment /=
    modulus assignment %=
    exponent assignment **=

c) Comparison operators
- The outcome of comparison operators is usually boolean expression
 (true or false)
- Examples:
    Equal ==
    Not Equal !=
    greater than >, greater than or equal to >=
    less than <, less than or equal to <=

d) Logical Operators
- Used in situations you want to check two conditions in one, or
need to negate a condition, the logical operators come in handy.
- You can use: 
    and  - &&
    or   - ||
    not  - !
