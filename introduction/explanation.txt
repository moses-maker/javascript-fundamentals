Variables
> Variables are addresses or name value in your code that can represent
different values each time the code runs.
> Before we deal with variables we will look at.

i) Identifier
- An Identifier is a named that user derive that is used to name concepts
in a programming language.
- In order to derive the name the following rules must be followed.
a) An identifier can be a combination of letters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
    Exception:
    - You can't begin with a digit, digit should be placed at the end.
    e.g. "9total" is wrong, instead say "total9".

b) Space between two words is not allowed, instead put underscore between 
the words.
    - E.g. 
    "total marks" is wrong instead you can say "total_marks"

Variable declaration & Initialization
> A variable definition and declaration consists of three parts;
    variable defining keywords;
        i) let 
        - This is used for variables that might have new value assigned to them
        somewhere in the program.
        - let has a block level scope, this means that you can only use 
        variables defined with "let" in the specific block of code in which
        they were defined.
        - A block of code will always start with { and end with }, which is 
        how you recognize them.

        Example:
            let total = 100;

        ii) var
        - This is used also for variables that might have new value assigned to 
        them somewhere in the program.
        - var has a global scopew which means that you can use the varibales defined with var 
        in the entire script

        Example:
            var result = 150;

        iii) const
        - It is used for variables that only get value assigned once
        for example the value of pi, which will not change.
        - Examples:
            const average = 45;
            average = 50;
            - This will result in an error.

COMMENTS
> Comments are used to explain what a program is all about.
> Any line of code starting with a comment symbol either single line or multiline comment 
is automatically ignored by the interpreter, and execution goes to the next line.
> Types of Comments
    a) simgleline comment   //
    Example:   // single line comment

    b) multiline comment /*   ...   */
    - This allows you to right a multiple line sentences as comment.
    Example:
        /*
            This is a multiline
            comment, 
        */

ii) Primitive datatypes
- Javascript has seven Primitive datatypes
    String
    -  string is used to store a text value. It is a sequence of characters.
    - there are different ways to declare a string.
        a) double quote
        b) single quote
        c) Backticks - special templates string in which you can use variable directly.
    Number
    BigInt
    Boolean
    Symbol
    Undefined
    null
