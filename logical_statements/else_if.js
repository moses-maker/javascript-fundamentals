/*
The syntax:

if(conditino){
    //action
}

else if(condition){
    //action
}

else{
    //action    
}
- if the evaluation of the first if's condition is true
the value e.g action within if block the { action } within
the block is executed.

- if it is false, the second if block is considered and also if evaluation of its 
condition result to false, the default condtion is considered hence the else{ action } 
block action is considered by default because all other conditions are false.
